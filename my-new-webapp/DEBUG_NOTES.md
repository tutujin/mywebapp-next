# Persistent Next.js Middleware Issue on Windows (D:\mywebapp-next\my-new-webapp)

**Date:** 2025年8月10日

**Problem Description:**
The `middleware.ts` file in the project root is not being executed by Next.js, leading to a 404 error on the root path (`/`) despite the `app/[locale]/page.tsx` being correctly configured and accessible via `/en`.

**Symptoms:**
- `curl http://localhost:3000/` returns a 404 (or 500 if build is corrupted).
- `curl http://localhost:3000/en` works (returns 200 OK).
- `console.log` statements in `middleware.ts` do not appear in `server.log`.
- `middleware.ts` is located at the project root, named correctly, and contains valid Next.js middleware code (both custom and `next-international` versions were tried).

**Root Cause Identified:**
The primary blocker is a persistent file lock on `node_modules` (specifically `next-swc.win32-x64-msvc.node`) on the Windows operating system. This prevents a clean deletion of `node_modules` and `.next` folders, leading to a corrupted or incomplete build state.

**Debugging Steps Attempted (and their outcomes):**
1.  **Initial `middleware.ts` debugging:**
    *   Confirmed `app/[locale]/page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` were correctly structured.
    *   Replaced custom middleware with `next-international`'s `createI18nMiddleware`.
    *   Simplified `matcher` in `middleware.ts`.
    *   Changed `urlMappingStrategy` to `redirect`.
    *   Added `console.log` statements to `middleware.ts` to check execution.
    *   **Outcome:** No `console.log` output in `server.log`, indicating middleware was not running. Root path still 404.

2.  **Clean Install Attempts:**
    *   Proposed deleting `node_modules` and `.next`, then `npm install`, then restart.
    *   **Attempt 1:** `rmdir /s /q node_modules` and `rmdir /s /q .next` failed with `EPERM` errors on `node_modules`.
    *   **Attempt 2 (more aggressive cleanup):**
        *   Tried `tasklist /fi "IMAGENAME eq node.exe"` and `tasklist | findstr "node.exe"` to find and kill Node.js processes. **Outcome:** No `node.exe` processes found by these commands, despite file lock.
        *   Tried `netstat -aon | findstr "3000"` to find processes listening on port 3000. **Outcome:** No processes found.
        *   **Conclusion:** File lock persists, but the process holding it cannot be identified or killed via standard CLI tools.

**Current Status & Next Action:**
The problem is currently blocked by the inability to perform a truly clean install due to the persistent file lock.

**Recommended Next Step (Manual User Action Required):**
**User needs to manually reboot their Windows machine** to clear the file locks.

**After Reboot:**
Once the system is rebooted, the following steps should be performed:
1.  Manually delete `D:\mywebapp-next\my-new-webapp\node_modules` and `D:\mywebapp-next\my-new-webapp\.next` folders to ensure they are completely gone.
2.  Run `npm cache clean --force`.
3.  Run `npm install`.
4.  Restart the Next.js development server (`npm run start:server > server.log 2>&1 &`).
5.  Verify `middleware.ts` execution by checking `server.log` for `console.log` output.
6.  Verify root path redirect by `curl http://localhost:3000/`.
